Example of a good missing-info response:

"Dear [Customer Name],

Thank you for contacting us regarding your warranty inquiry. We're here to help!

To check your warranty status and provide you with accurate information, I'll need your product's serial number. This unique identifier allows us to look up your specific warranty details.

You can find your serial number in several places:
- On a label or sticker on the product itself (usually on the bottom, back, or inside the battery compartment)
- On the original product packaging or box
- On your purchase receipt or invoice
- In the product manual or documentation

The serial number typically starts with "SN" and contains a combination of letters and numbers (e.g., SN12345).

Once you locate your serial number, please reply to this email with it, and I'll be happy to check your warranty status right away.

If you have any trouble finding the serial number, please don't hesitate to let me know, and I'll provide additional guidance.

Best regards,
Warranty Support Team"
